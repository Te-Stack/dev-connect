It's like a mini social media app where developers can build their profiles and share their thoughts.

In the profile page, it highlights the last three github repos updated by the user (If the user has a GitHub username)

I wanted to learn SASS, so I took a tutorial by Traversy media on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFM9hbapeA0).

After the tutorial I decided to make a functional web app. It's a PWA as well.

This Web app was built using the follwoing technologies

```
HTML
CSS
SASS
Python
Javascript (ES6)
React
NextJS
Django
Django Rest Framework
```
